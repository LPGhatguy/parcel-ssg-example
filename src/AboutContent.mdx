# About

This is my cool new website.

## What's it _really_ about?

This site is a demo for how you can build your own [static site generator](https://www.google.com/search?q=static+site+generator) using **React**, *Parcel*, and a little bit of JS. It's intended to show that building something like this isn't so difficult, and by building the foundations yourself, a lot of cool things are possible!

This page is build using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a powerful mix of MarkDown and JSX.
